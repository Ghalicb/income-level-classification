### Logistic Regression Analysis of the Income Level in the US Based on Socio-Demographic Variables

The aim of the study is to predict whether a person earn more than 50â€™000$ per year based on socio-demographic data. The data used for this analysis were extracted from the 1994 Census Bureau Database and gathered in the [Adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).

The result of this study is important because it confirms using a rigorous statistical methodology that socio-demographic factors play a role in income distribution, although this is prohibited by law.
